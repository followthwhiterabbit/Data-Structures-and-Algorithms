# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
##Common Data Structures and Algorithms and their implementations 

###The repository contains the implementation of the data structures and algorithms with and without using STL containers. 


####The data structures covered in the repository are:<br />
1 - Linked lists and Arrays<br />
2 - Stacks<br />
3 - Queues<br /> 
4 - Binary Trees and Binary Search trees<br />
5 - Graph and Adjacency list<br />
6 - Hashing<br /> 
7 - Heap<br />
8 - Matrix<br />

####The STL containers covered are:<br />
1 - Array<br />
2 - Vector<br />
3 - Deque<br />
4 - List<br />
5 - Forward List<br />
6 - set<br /> 
7 - map<br /> 
8 - multiset<br />
9 - multimap<br /> 

as well as the unordered Associative Containers<br /> 

Every file has an explanation for the general concepts of the data structures for visualizing purposes
