# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
## Common Data Structures and Algorithms and their implementations 

### The repository contains the implementation of the data structures and algorithms with and without using STL containers. 


#### The data structures covered in the repository are:<br />
- Linked lists and Arrays<br />
- Stacks<br />
- Queues<br /> 
- Binary Trees and Binary Search trees<br />
- Graph and Adjacency list<br />
- Hashing<br /> 
- Heap<br />
- Matrix<br />

#### The STL containers covered are:<br />
- Array<br />
- Vector<br />
- Deque<br />
- List<br />
- Forward List<br />
- set<br /> 
- map<br /> 
- multiset<br />
- multimap<br /> 

as well as the unordered Associative Containers<br /> 

Every file has an explanation for the general concepts of the data structures for visualizing purposes
