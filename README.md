# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Common Data Structures and Algorithms and their implementations 

The repository contains the implementation of the data structures and algorithms with and without using STL containers. 


The data structures covered in the repository are: <br />
1 - Linked lists and Arrays
2 - Stacks
3 - Queues 
4 - Binary Trees and Binary Search trees
5 - Graph and Adjacency list
6 - Hashing 
7 - Heap
8 - Matrix 

The STL containers covered are
1 - Array
2 - Vector
3 - Deque
4 - List
5 - Forward List
6 - set 
7 - map 
8 - multiset
9 - multimap 

as well as the unordered Associative Containers 

Every file has an explanation for the general concepts of the data structures for visualizing purposes
